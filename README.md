# Advent of Code 2024 - Go

Using advent of code familiarize myself with golang.

The goal is to solve all puzzles with no external packages, meaning I will
implement datastructures, algorithms, etc. in go.

The project structure may change over time as I add solutions and packages.

## Usage

1. Get your inputs for each day on the [official website](https://adventofcode.com/2024)
and add them to the respective `dayX` directory.
2. `cd` into `dayX` folder, then `go run .`
3. The answers will be printed out on the command line

Inputs are in `.gitignore` to not expose them as requested by the Advent of Code guy.
