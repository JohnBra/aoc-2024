# Advent of Code - Go

Using advent of code to familiarize myself with golang.

The goal is to solve all puzzles without external packages. Forcing myself
to build things like datastructures and algorithms from scratch.

The project structure may change over time as I add solutions and packages.

## Usage

1. Get your inputs for each day on the [official website](https://adventofcode.com/2024)
and add them to the respective `dayX` directory.
2. `go run <year>/<day>/main.go -input=<path to puzzle input>`
3. The answers will be printed out on the command line

Inputs are in `.gitignore` to not expose them as requested by the Advent of Code guy.
